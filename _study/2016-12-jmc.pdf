The Roots of Lisp, Paul Graham


1. Seven Primitive Operators.

Expression: sequence of letters or a list or zero or more expressions
foo
()


lists are (operator, arguments ...)

7 Primitives: 
quote􏰀 atom􏰀 eq􏰀 car􏰀 cdr􏰀 cons􏰀 and cond

quote x returns x
atom x returns t /truthy or () / falsy

unquoted list is code --- 
quoted list is a list --- protected from evaluation

"code and data are made out of the same data structures, and the quote operator is the way we distinguish between them"


EQ returns t if both inputs are empty list, and () otherwise

CAR expects value of x to be a list, returns its first element

CDR like car, returns rest...


CONS 􏰏cons x y􏰐 exp ects the value of y to b e a list􏰀 and returns a list containing the value of x followed by the elements of the value of y􏰅


􏰏cond 􏰏p􏰁 e􏰁􏰐 􏰌 􏰌 􏰌 􏰏pn en􏰐􏰐 is evaluated as follows􏰅 The p expressions are evaluated in order until one returns t􏰅 When one is found􏰀 the value of
the corresp onding e expression is returned as the expression􏰅

Quote and cond are evaluated differently:
When a quote expression is evaluated􏰀 its argument is not evaluated􏰀 but is simply
returned as the value of the whole quote expression􏰅 And in a valid cond expression􏰀 only an
L􏰈shap ed path of sub expressions will b e evaluated􏰅



2. DENOTING FUNTIONS:
􏰏􏰏lambda 􏰏p􏰁 􏰌 􏰌 􏰌 pn􏰐 e􏰐 a􏰁 􏰌 􏰌 􏰌 an􏰐
is called a function cal l and its value is computed as follows􏰅 Each expression ai is evaluated􏰅 Then e is evaluated􏰅 During the evaluation of e􏰀 the value of
any o ccurrence of one of the pi is the value of the corresp onding ai in recent function call􏰅


In other words􏰀 parameters can b e used as arguments􏰌
􏰛 􏰏􏰏lambda 􏰏f􏰐 􏰏f 􏰋􏰏b c􏰐􏰐􏰐 􏰋􏰏lambda 􏰏x􏰐 􏰏cons 􏰋a x􏰐􏰐􏰐

There is currently no runtime enforcement of arity when calling a fn
